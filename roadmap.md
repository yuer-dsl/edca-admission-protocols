# Admission Protocol Roadmap

This repository defines the first admission-layer protocol for EDCA OS.

Planned protocol families include:

- Data Admission Protocol
- Device Admission Protocol
- Model Admission Protocol
- Platform Admission Protocol

All admission protocols share:
- explicit boot conditions
- instantiation requirements
- rejection semantics
- auditability

Alignment Protocol v3.0 serves as the reference template.
